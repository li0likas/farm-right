# Farm Right - Farm management system

## Base idea would be to develop a web application for documenting agricultural fields, recording the activities performed in them etc. If I would decide to proceed with this subject in the final project, it would be possible to extend appicationâ€˜s functionality by adding something like AI-Powered Crop Health Prediction, Automated Drone Integration for Field Monitoring, Real-Time Collaboration for Farmers, Weather-Based Task Automation etc.


# Objects: 

Farm -> Fields -> Tasks (for example, sowing, spraying, harvesting) -> Details (machinery used, comments, etc.)

# Roles:

Agronomist: Can browse farms and basic crop information.
Worker: Can manage farm tasks, add crops, and monitor progress.
Farmer (owner): Can add/remove workers, manage overall farm data, and oversee all tasks.

# User Interface (wireframe)

# UML Deployment Diagram

`main` branch - dedicated to latest and tested features, only merge when everything is alright. 
`dev` branch - for all the work-in-progress features. If two or more users are working on the same feature, a new, seperate development branch should be created.
